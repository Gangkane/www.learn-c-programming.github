<h2 style="color:blue">What is C</h2>
<span style="font-size:1.9em"><b><i>C</i></b></span>is one of the older programming languages.<br> It was developed by <b>Dennis Ritchie</b> and was developed in 1972.It is was developed to accoplish and implement UNIX operating system, but it is still very powerful thanks to how low-level it is.<br>
 Learning C is a great way to introduce yourself to more complex languages as well, and the knowledge you gain will be useful in almost every programming language and can help you get into app development.</span></h3><br>
 First, we need to know that computers are built to execute instructions written in what is called machine language.<br> In machine language, everything is expressed in terms of the binary number system—1s and 0s. <br>
 Each computer has its own machine language and the computer can execute instructions written in that language only.<br> The instructions themselves are very simple: for example, add or subtract two numbers, compare one number with another, or copy a number from one place to another. <br><br>
 Machine language is considered a low-level programming language. <br>In the early days of computing (1940s and ‘50s) programmers had to write programs in machine language, that is, express all their instructions using 1s and 0s. <br>
To make life a little easier for them, assembly language was developed. This was closely related to machine language but it allowed the programmer to use mnemonic instruction codes (such as ADD and names for storage locations (such as sum) rather than strings of binary digits (bits). <br>For instance, a programmer could refer to a number by sum rather than have to remember that the number was stored in memory location 1000011101101011. <br><br>
