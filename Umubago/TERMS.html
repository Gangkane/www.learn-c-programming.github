<p>This <b>Website</b> attempts to teach computer programming to the complete beginner using the C language. As such, it assumes you have no knowledge whatsoever about programming. And if you are worried that you are not good at high-school mathematics, don’t be. It is a myth that you must be good at mathematics to learn programming. <br>In this Website, knowledge of primary school mathematics is all that is required—basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding the percentage of some quantity, finding an average or the larger of two quantities
<br><br>
The first step in becoming a good programmer is learning the syntax rules of the programming language. This is the easy part and many people mistakenly believe that this makes them a programmer. They get carried away by the cosmetics—they learn the features of a language without learning how to use them to solve problems
