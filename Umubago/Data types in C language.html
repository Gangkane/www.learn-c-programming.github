<h2>Data types in C language</h2><br>
<h2><u>Data types</u></h2>
<p>You will discover many data types in your programming career, such as numbers, dates, strings, Boolean, arrays, objects, and data structures. <br>Although this book covers some of the aforementioned data types in later chapters, this course will concentrate on the following primary data types:
</p>
<h3>
<ul>
<li>Integers</li><br>
<li> Floating-point numbers</li><br>
<li> Character</li><br>
</ul>
</h3>
<h2>Integers</h2>
<p>Integers are whole numbers that represent positive and negative numbers, such as 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, and 3, but not decimal or fractional numbers.<br>
Integer data types hold a maximum of four bytes of information and are declared with the int (short for integer) keyword, as shown in the following line of code.<br><br>
int x;<br><br>
In C, you can declare more than one variable on the same line using a single int declaration statement with each variable name separated by commas, as demonstrated next.<br><br>
int x, y, z;<br><br>
The preceding variable declaration declares three integer variables named x, y, and z. Remem- ber from Chapter 1 that executable program statements such as a print statement or in this case a variable declaration require a statement terminator (;).
</p>
<h2>Floating-point numbers</h2>
<p>Floating-point numbers are all numbers, including signed and unsigned decimal and fractional numbers. <br>Signed numbers include positive and negative numbers whereas unsigned numbers can only include positive values. <br>Examples of floating-point numbers are shown in the following list.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> 09.4543 </li><br>
<li> 3428.27 </li><br>
<li> 112.34329 </li><br>
<li> -342.66 </li><br>
<li> -55433.33281
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Use the keyword float to declare floating-point numbers, as shown next</b>.<br><br>
float operand1; <br>float operand2;<br> float result;<br><br>
The preceding code declares three floating-point variable data types called operand1, operand2, and result.</p>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<h3>Character data types are representations of integer values known as character codes. For exam- ple, the character code 90 represents the letter Z. <br>
Note that the letter Z is not the same as the character code 122, which represents the letter z (lowercase letter z).<br>
Characters represent more than just the letters of the alphabet; they also represent numbers 0 through 9, special characters such as the asterisk (*), and keyboard keys such as the Del (delete) key and Esc (escape) key. In all, there are a total of 128 common character codes (0 through 127), which make up the most commonly used characters of a keyboard.
Character codes are most notably organized through the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set.<br><br>
In C, character variables are created using the char (short for character) keyword as demon- strated next.
char firstInitial; char middleInitial; char lastInitial;
Character data assigned to character variables must be enclosed in single quotes ('), also known as tick marks or apostrophes.<br> As youâ€™ll see in the next section, the equal sign (=) is used for assigning data to the character variable.<br>
<u>i.e</u><br>
char firstInitial;
