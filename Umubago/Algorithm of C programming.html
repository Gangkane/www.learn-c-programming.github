<h2 style="color:blue">Introduction to Algorithm</h2>
<p><b> Definition of Algorithms <b></u></p>
<p>The word <u><b>Algorithm</b></u> means “<b>a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations</b>”. <br>Therefore, Algorithm refers to a set of rules/instructions that step-by-step define how a work is to be executed upon in order to get the expected results. <br> 
It can be understood by taking an example of cooking a new recipe.<br><br><br> To cook a new recipe, one reads the instructions and steps and execute them one by one, in the given sequence. <br>The result thus obtained is the new dish cooked perfectly. <br>Similarly, algorithms help to do a task in programming to get the expected output.<br>  
The Algorithm designed are language-independent, i.e. they are just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be the same, as expected.  
</p>
<h2 style="color:blue">How to design Algorithm?</h2>
<p><b>In order to write an algorithm, following things are needed as a pre-requisite: </b> 
</p>
<ol><li>The problem that is to be solved by this algorithm. </li>
<li>The constraints of the problem that must be considered while solving the problem. </li>
<li>The input to be taken to solve the problem. </li>
<li>The output to be expected when the problem is solved</li>
<li>The solution to this problem, in the given constraints. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Algorithm to add 3 numbers and print their sum: </b></p>
<p> <ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>START </li> <li> Declare 3 integer variables num1, num2 and num3.</li> <br><li>  Take the three numbers, to be added, as inputs in variables num1, num2, and num3 respectively.</li> <li> Declare an integer variable sum to store the resultant sum of the 3 numbers.</li> <li> Add the 3 numbers and store the result in the variable sum.</li>  <li>Print the value of variable sum </li> <li> END   </li>
