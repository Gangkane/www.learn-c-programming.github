<h2>Ponter to function</h2>
<p>One of the greatest benefits of using pointers is the ability to pass arguments to functions by reference. By default, arguments are passed by value in C, which involves making a copy of the incoming argument for the function to use. <br>
Depending on the storage requirements of the incoming argument, this may not be the most efficient use of memory</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<img src="y.png" style="width:auto;height:auto"><br>
<p>In this program, I pass two integer arguments to my addTwoNumbers function in a printf() function. This type of argument passing is called passing by value. More specifically, C reserves extra memory space to make a copy of variables x and y and the copies of x and y are then sent to the function as arguments. <br><br>
