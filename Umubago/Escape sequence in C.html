<h2 style="color:blue">Escape sequence in C</h2>
<p>This particular escape sequence (\n) tells the program to add a new line.<br> Take a look at the following program statement. How many new lines are added to standard output with this one printf() function?<br><br>
printf("\nC you later\n");<br><br>
This printf() function adds two new lines for formatting purposes. Before any text is shown, the program outputs a new line. <br>After the text is written to standard output, in this case the computer screen, another new line is written.</p>
<h3 style="color:blue">Describes some common escape sequences.</p><br>
<h3 style="color:blue">Escape Sequence: </h3>
<p>\n :Creates a new line <br>
\t :Moves the cursor to the next tab <br>
\r :Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line<br>
 \\ :Inserts a backslash<br>
 \" :Inserts a double quote <br>
\' :Inserts a single quote
</p>

<h2>Escape Sequence \n </h2>

<h2>Escape Sequence \t </h2>
<p><b>Escape sequence \t</b> moves the cursor to the next tab space. <br>This escape sequence is useful for formatting output in many ways. For example, a common formatting desire is to create columns in your output, as the following program statements demonstrate.
</p>
<p><b>As shown in Figure</b> , the preceding program statements create formatted columns that display a sample calendar month.
</p>

<h2>Escape Sequence \r </h2>
<p>You may find the escape sequence \r useful for some formatting tasks when the cursorâ€™s position is of importance, especially with printed output because a printer can overwrite text
already printing. <br>The following program code demonstrates how it works; the output is shown in the figure
</p>

<h2>Escape Sequence \\ </h2>
<p><b>Escape sequence \\ </b>inserts a backslash into your text. This may seem unnecessary at first, but remember that whenever the program reads a backslash in a printf() function, it expects to see a valid escape character right after it. In other words, the backslash character (\) is a special character in the printf() function; if you need to display a backslash in your text, you must use this escape sequence.
The following program statement demonstrates escape sequence \\. <br>The output is shown in Figure

<h2>Escape Sequence \" </h2>
<p>Another reserved character in <b>the printf()</b> function is the double quote<b> (") </b>character. To insert a quote into your outputted text, use the escape sequence \" as demonstrated in the following program statement.<br> The output is shown in Figure
</p>

<h2>Escape Sequence \' </h2>
<p>Similar to the double quote escape sequence <b>(\")</b> is the single quote (also called an apostrophe) escape sequence <b>(\')</b>. To insert a single quote into your outputted text, use the escape sequence \' as demonstrated in the following program statement and in Figure </p>
