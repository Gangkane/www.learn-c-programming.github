<h2>Call by value and call by references</h2>
<p><b>Function can be called in two ways:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Call by value</li>
<li>Call by reference</li>
</ul>
<h2>Call by value</h2>
<p>In this type of calling a function direct value is passed at time of calling.<br>
In call by value the changes made in formal parameters don't reflect in actual parameters.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<img src="gangstar.png" style="width:auto;height:auto">
<p>As you see above we can see that direct value is passed at the time of calling.<br>Here is actual parameter and   is formal parameter.</p>
<h2>Call by reference</h2>
<p>In this type of calling a function the reference of the value is passed at the time of calling.<br>Reference is also called address and when the address of data is passed at the time of calling so it is necessary to use pointer in the place of parameter</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>to see the difference betwwen call by reference and call by value you can focus on the output of thep program</p>
