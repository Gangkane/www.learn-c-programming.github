<h2>Array of Structure</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to store data on 100 students. We will need an array of size 100, and each element of the array will hold the data for one student. Thus, each element will have to be a structure – we need an <b>“array of structures.”</b><br><br> 
We can declare the array with the following, similar to how we say “int pupil[100]” to declare an integer array of size 100:<br>
<b>Student pupil[100];</b><br><br>
This allocates storage for pupil[0], pupil[1], pupil[2], …, up to pupil[99]. Each element pupil[i] consists of three fields that can be referred to as follows:<br><br>
pupil[i].name   pupil[i].age   pupil[i].gender<br><br>
First we will need to store some data in the array. Assume we have data in the following format (name, age, gender):<br><br>
"Jack, Willson" 25 M 
"Catherina, Lisa" 28 F 
"Eddy, Sandy" 29 F 
"David, William" 36 M 
"END"
