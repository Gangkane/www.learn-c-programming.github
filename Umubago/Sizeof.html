<h2>Sizeof</h2>
<p>
There will be occasions when you need to know how large a variable or data type is. This is especially important in C, because C allows programmers to create memory resources dynam- ically. More specifically, it is imperative for C programmers to know how many bytes a system uses to store data, such as integers, floats, or doubles, because not all systems use the same amount of space for storing data. The C standard library provides the sizeof operator to assist programmers in this type of situation. When used in your programs, the sizeof operator will help you build a more system-independent software program.<br><br>
The sizeof operator takes a variable name or data type as an argument and returns the num- ber of bytes required to store the data in memory.
