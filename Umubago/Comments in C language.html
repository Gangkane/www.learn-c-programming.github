<h2>Comment in c language</h2><br>
<h2><u>Comments</u></h2>
<p>Comments are an integral part of program code in any programming language. Comments help to identify program purpose and explain complex routines. <br>They can be valuable to you as the programmer and to other programmers looking at your code.<br><br>
In the following line of code, the text C Programming for the Absolute Beginner is ignored by the compiler because it is surrounded with the character sets <b>/* and */.</b><br>
<br>
<b>/* Learn c programming */</b><br><br>
The character set /* signifies the beginning of a comment block; the character set */ identifies the end of a comment block. These character sets are not required to be on the same line and can be used to create both single-line and multi-line comments.<br> To demonstrate, the following block of code shows the usefulness of multi-line commenting.<br><br>
<b>/*     I am starting C programming for beginners */</b><br><br>
Your C program may not compile correctly if you leave one of the comment character sets out or if you reverse the characters. For example, the following code segment leaves out a comment character set and will not compile.
<b>/* C programming it is easy</b>
The next line of code also will not compile because comment character sets have been incor- rectly ordered.
<b>*/ C Programming for Beginner */</b><br><br>
You can also create quick one-line comments with the character set //. The next line of code demonstrates this.
<b>//by programmer</b><br>
Any characters read after the character set // are ignored by the compiler for that line only. To create a multi-line comment block with character set //, you will need the comment characters in front of each line. For example, the following code creates a multi-line comment block.
