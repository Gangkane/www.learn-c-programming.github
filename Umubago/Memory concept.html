<h2>Memory concept</h2>
<p>This chapter is dedicated to discussing dynamic memory concepts, such as allo- cating, reallocating, and freeing memory using the functions malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free(). This section specifically reviews essential memory concepts that directly relate to how these functions receive and use memory.<br><br>
Software programs, including operating systems, use a variety of memory imple- mentations, including virtual memory and RAM. Random access memory (RAM)provides a volatile solution for allocating, storing, and retrieving data. RAM is considered volatile because of its inability to store data after the computer loses power (shuts down). Another volatile memory storage area is called virtual memory. Essentially, virtual memory is a reserved section of your hard disk in which the operating system can swap memory seg- ments. Virtual memory is not as efficient as random access memory, but it provides an impression to the CPU that it has more memory than it really does. Increasing memory resources through virtual memory provides the operating system an inexpensive solution for dynamic memory demands.
