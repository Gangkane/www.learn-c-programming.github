<h2>Two-Dimensional Array</h2>
<p>Two-dimensional arrays are even more interesting structures than their single-dimension counterparts. The easiest way to understand or think about two-dimensional arrays is to visu- alize a table with rows and columns (e.g. a checkerboard, chessboard, or spreadsheet). C, however, implements two-dimensional arrays as single-dimension arrays with pointers to other single-dimension arrays. <br><br>
int arr[3][3];<br><br>
The array declaration above creates a total of 9 elements (remember that array indexes start with number 0). Two-dimensional arrays are accessed with two element numbers, one for the column and one for the row.
</p>
<h2>Initialize two dimensional array</h2>
<p>You can also use looping structures, such as the for loop, to initialize your two-dimensional arrays. As you might expect, there is a bit more work when initializing or searching a two- dimensional array. Essentially, you must create a nested looping structure for searching or accessing each element, as shown in the next program</p>
